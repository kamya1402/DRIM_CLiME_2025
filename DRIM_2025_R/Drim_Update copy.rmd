### Merge Census Tract Data with Household Income Data** ###

  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  mutate(GEOID = as.character(GEOID)) %>%  # Convert GEOID to character

### Aggregate Census Tract Data to Neighborhood Level** ###

# Rename "NAME" column in newark_nbd_sf to match the Neighborhood column
newark_nbd_sf <- newark_nbd_sf %>%
  rename(Neighborhood = name)

# Check CRS of both datasets
st_crs(newark_nbd_sf)  # Check CRS of neighborhood polygons

### Convert Aggregated Data to SF Object & Ensure Matching CRS** ###
# Convert income data into an sf object
income_nbd_agg_sf <- st_as_sf(income_nbd_agg, coords = NULL, crs = st_crs(newark_nbd_sf))

# Ensure both datasets use the same CRS
income_nbd_agg_sf <- st_transform(income_nbd_agg_sf, st_crs(newark_nbd_sf))

### **Step 5: Perform Spatial Join Using `st_join()` to Attach Income Data to Neighborhoods** ###
income_nbd_sf <- st_join(newark_nbd_sf, income_nbd_agg_sf, join = st_intersects)

# Drop any duplicate columns (if needed)
income_nbd_sf <- income_nbd_sf %>%
